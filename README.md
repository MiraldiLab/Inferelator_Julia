# Inferelator_Julia

This repository contains a workflow for inference of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) from gene expression data and prior information, as described in:

Miraldi et al., Leveraging chromatin accessibility for transcriptional regulatory network inference in T Helper 17 Cells.

The main workflow is found here: \
[workflow.jl](https://github.com/MiraldiLab/Inferelator_Julia/blob/main/Testing/workflow.jl) \
This workflow can benefit from parallelization, with significant speedups from using multiple cores. The workflow can be run on the BMI cluster with n cores using the bat file: \
[workflow.bat](https://github.com/MiraldiLab/Inferelator_Julia/blob/main/Testing/workflow.bat) \
